'''The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1² + 2² +...+ 10² = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2+...+10)² = 55² = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
3025 - 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.'''
